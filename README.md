# 🎼 Hi! I don't know what I'm doing 👌🏻

No, really, I don't. Please, someone, tell me what is going on.

- Run a minecraft server, which is currently under re-construction 
- Have staffed, worked on, and ran servers since MC version 1.5 
- I use intelliJ
- I use Maven, don't know how to use Gradle yet
