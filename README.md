# üéµ Hi! I'm Rhythmic
### I'm mostly a Minecraft plugin developer who makes stuff for customization and accessibility. 
- üíª I work on Purpur, a fork of Paper that focuses on customization and features. Check it out [here](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur).
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm the owner and head developer of [Simplexity Development](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development), an organization dedicated mostly to developing plugins and resources for Minecraft servers
### üé® My most successful projects include:
  - [High Contrast Extended](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/High_Contrast_Extended): a Minecraft resource pack that extends the default high-contrast pack to the rest of the game.
  - [Entity Icons](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/Entity-Icons): a free resource that has icons of every mob in the game, open for anyone who wants to use icons in their mods, plugins, datapacks, or similar things.
  - [VillagerInfo](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/VillagerInfo): a Minecraft plugin that shows useful information about villagers, that is usually only available through admin commands. Currently being rewritten on [VillagerInfo-Rewrite](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/VillagerInfo-Rewrite).
  - [Scythe](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/Scythe): a Minecraft plugin that allows for auto-replanting, and right-click harvest on crops.

### üìù Some other projects I recommend looking at:
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Rhythmic): This is where I publish my projects, downloading from here supports me as they have a creator fund.
- [PurpurExtras](https://github.com/PurpurMC/PurpurExtras): A plugin that adds features that have been requested for Purpur that would be better executed as a plugin
- [PurpurPacks](https://github.com/PurpurMC/PurpurPacks) Datapacks that are items that have been requested for Purpur, or would fit it's theme, but work better as datapacks
- [Pl3xMap](https://github.com/BillyGalbreath/Pl3xMap) *~~v2~~ v3 under construction!* A lightweight online map that matches the in-game map style<br>
- [CommandWhitelist](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/CommandWhitelist) A plugin that gives you the ability to only whitelist certain commands to be used, as many plugins do not properly assign commands to permissions, and people see many commands in their tabcomplete list that they actually cannot use
